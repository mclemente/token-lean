# Token Lean
Want to look around corners without moving your token? Stack up on a door and peek around? Just lean!  
While holding down the lean button (default q), your token's vision and light source are moved towards your mouse.  

Includes options to restrict leaning when paused or in combat.
The maximum distance you can lean is configurable.
  
## Caveats
Sometimes vision isn't blocked properly when leaning towards a wall.

This is a Core FoundryVTT issue (https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9531)
